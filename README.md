&nbsp;&nbsp;CleanDb is a tool for creating and maintaining business equipment inventories. There are many inventory tools but none specific to the business equipment industry that are meant to be worked with onsite on a regular basis. This tool is meant to ease the task of maintaining accurate inventories of business equipment deployed at a MPS locations. Equipment often moves around and updating a database can be a tedious task that takes up too much time leading to horrible inaccurate inventories. This tool was created with the onsite staff in mind who are tasked with servicing and maintaining business equipment.
